# Artificial-Intelligence

This is a repository of all the files I used in my Artificial Intelligence classes I and II in 2019 and 2020 where I used algorithms such as A*, Brute-Force, Greedy Choice, Minimax, and DFS to solve slider-puzzles, solve Sudoku puzzles, use Regular Expressions to parse various strings, create a Othello game AI, and train a neural network to successfully parse the MNIST handwritten numbers data.
